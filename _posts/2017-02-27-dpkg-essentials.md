When working with Debian[^1] or Ubuntu[^2] systems, you will get in contact with Debians package manager `apt` (Advances packaging tool)[^3]. But `apt` itself is only a frontend of `dpkg` making available higher-level functions such as `autoremove` or `update`. While being the tool of choice for installing packages, `apt` tends to be rather restrictive if you want to cleanup your system, e.g., after you've tested a package temporarily. So here are some things you can do in that case with `dpkg` and `dpkg-query`.

# List, remove and purge installed packages

Using `dpkg-query` it is very easy to list all packages currently (semi-) installed on your system. Using `--showformat` we're able to control the information displayed effectively removing table headers and descriptions used by `dpkg-query` by default.

```bash
basti@home:~$ dpkg-query --show --showformat='${db:Status-Abbrev} ${binary:Package} ${Version}\n'
ii  a11y-profile-manager-indicator 0.1.10-0ubuntu3
ii  account-plugin-facebook 0.12+16.04.20160126-0ubuntu1
ii  account-plugin-flickr 0.12+16.04.20160126-0ubuntu1
ii  account-plugin-google 0.12+16.04.20160126-0ubuntu1
ii  accountsservice 0.6.40-2ubuntu11.3
rc  accountwizard 4:15.12.3-0ubuntu1
ii  acl 2.2.52-3
ii  acpi-support 0.142
ii  acpid 1:2.0.26-1ubuntu2
ii  activity-log-manager 0.9.7-0ubuntu23
```

Notice the first entry on each line. While many combinations are possible[^4], generally you will come across `ii` for installed packages, `rc` for packages that have been removed, but some (configuration) files remained and `un` for fully uninstalled packages. Building up on that, numerous cleanups are possible. So let's create an alias and have a look.

```bash
basti@home:~$ alias dql="dpkg-query --show --showformat='\${db:Status-Abbrev} \${binary:Package} \${Version}\n'"
```

**Count installed packages**

```bash
basti@home:~$ dql | grep -e "^ii" | wc -l
3118
```

**List all packages matching a pattern**

```bash
basti@home:~$ dql *xfce4*
un  xfce4
un  xfce4-power-manager
```

**Purge all semi-installed packages**

To remove all packages, that had been removed but not purged yet, combine the upper command with some basic linux pipes:

```bash
basti@home:~$ dql | grep -e "^rc" | awk '{print $2}' | sudo xargs dpkg -P
```

**Remove everything matching a pattern**

Be careful. This is highly automated. Make sure you set the right pattern.

```bash
basti@home:~$ dql *php*mysql* | grep -v -e "^un" | awk '{print $2}' | xargs sudo dpkg -P
```

# Show all files related to a packages

Often you want to know, where a package was installed and what files are package-relevant. That's a `dpkg-query` no-brainer.

```bash
basti@home:~$ dpkg-query -L account-plugin-facebook
/.
/usr
/usr/share
/usr/share/doc
...
/etc/signon-ui
/etc/signon-ui/webkit-options.d
/etc/signon-ui/webkit-options.d/www.facebook.com.conf
/usr/share/doc/account-plugin-facebook/changelog.Debian.gz
```

# Working with the log

As most linux tools, `dpkg` writes a log to `/var/log/dpkg.log` that can be utilized to gather some valuable information for system cleaup. For example you could list the timestamps and names of all package installations.

```bash
basti@home:~$ awk '$3~/^install$/ {print $1" "$2" "$4;}' /var/log/dpkg.log
...
2017-02-27 18:09:36 libevent-core-2.0-5:amd64
2017-02-27 18:09:36 mysql-server-5.7:amd64
2017-02-27 18:09:37 libhtml-template-perl:all
2017-02-27 18:09:37 mysql-server:all
2017-02-27 19:24:43 nano:amd64
```

This output can be piped through date parsing to find out, e.g., what packages had been installed within the last hour.

```bash
basti@home:~$ look_back_minutes=60; oldest=$( echo "$( date +%s ) - 60 * $look_back_minutes" | bc ); awk '$3~/^install$/ {print $1" "$2" "$4;}' /var/log/dpkg.log | tac | while read line; do ts=$( date --date="$( awk '{ print $1" "$2 }' <<< $line )" +%s); [ $ts -ge $oldest ] && echo $line || break; done

2017-02-27 19:24:43 nano:amd64
```

The code reads the log file reversed (`tac`) and breaks when the first entry was found, that does not suite the timing condition anymore. Disclaimer: The code above is pretty slow, so I'd be happily accept advice on optimization.
